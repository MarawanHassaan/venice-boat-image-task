## About the Project
The primary objective of this project is to utilize computer vision methods to analyze images of boats in Venice. The project includes image preprocessing, object detection, and segmentation tasks, which are essential for applications in urban planning, tourism analysis, and environmental monitoring.

---

## Features
- Image preprocessing for noise reduction and enhancement.
- Object detection to identify boats and other key objects in images.
- Semantic segmentation for pixel-level analysis of images.
- Visualization of processed images and detection results.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:**
  - OpenCV (Image processing)
  - NumPy (Numerical computations)
  - TensorFlow/PyTorch (Deep learning frameworks for object detection and segmentation)
  - Matplotlib/Seaborn (Data visualization)

---

## Dataset
The dataset consists of images of boats in Venice, either sourced from public datasets or collected manually. These images are used for training and evaluating the detection and segmentation models.

**Note:** Due to copyright restrictions, the dataset is not included in this repository. Ensure you have the appropriate dataset in the `data/` directory before running the code.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MarawanHassaan/venice-boat-image-task.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd venice-boat-image-task
   ```

3. **Set up a virtual environment (optional):**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # For Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## Usage

1. **Preprocess the dataset:**
   Run the preprocessing script to clean and enhance the images:
   ```bash
   python preprocess.py
   ```

2. **Train the model:**
   Train the object detection or segmentation model using the provided training script:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

3. **Evaluate the model:**
   Evaluate the model's performance on the test dataset:
   ```bash
   python evaluate.py
   ```

4. **Run the application:**
   Use the trained model to process new images:
   ```bash
   python detect.py --image path/to/image.jpg
   ```
